1. Healthcare Analytics Dashboard
An end-to-end analytics solution built with Python + Power BI that processes appointment, billing, and revenue data from a simulated hospital setting to generate executive-level KPIs and interactive visuals. The dashboard highlights appointment performance (completed, cancelled, no-show), identifies trends and high-risk visit types, analyzes revenue leakage from failed or pending payments, and delivers insights for operational and financial decision-making.

2. Heart Disease Prediction (ML Project)
A machine learning-based healthcare prediction project that builds a model to predict the likelihood of heart disease using clinical data and health indicators (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure). It involves data preprocessing, training multiple classification algorithms, evaluating model performance (accuracy, precision, recall), and showcasing prediction results through analysis and possible interfaces (e.g., web demo).
